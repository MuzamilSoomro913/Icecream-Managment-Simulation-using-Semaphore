# Ice-Cream Factory Problem Simulation

## Introduction
The project is a simulation of an **Ice-Cream Factory Problem**, designed to demonstrate concurrency and resource management using semaphores in a multithreaded environment. It integrates graphical representation with the **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)** for visual interaction.

---

## Objective
To simulate an ice-cream shop with multiple customers, each undergoing a sequence of processes:
1. Acquiring a ticket.
2. Selecting a flavor.
3. Adding toppings.
4. Completing payment.

The goal is to ensure synchronized access to limited resources while visually displaying customer progress.

## Features
1. **Concurrency Management**:
   - Multiple customers are simulated as threads.
   - Semaphores synchronize shared resources like tickets, flavors, toppings, and payment counters.

2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
   - The SFML library is used to render a user-friendly interface.
   - Buttons allow the user to specify the number of customers (1â€“5).
   - Animated progress of customers is shown in the GUI, from entering the shop to payment completion.

3. **Revenue Calculation**:
   - Each customer contributes a fixed amount of revenue ($100).
   - The total revenue is calculated and displayed at the end of the simulation.

## Implementation

### a. Languages and Libraries
- **C++**: Core programming language.
- **SFML**: For graphics rendering.
- **Pthreads**: For managing threading.
- **POSIX Semaphores**: For resource synchronization.

### b. Core Components
1. **Main Process Workflow**:
   - Users select the number of customers via GUI buttons.
   - Threads are created for each customer.
   - Each thread executes the `ice_cream()` function, simulating customer actions.

2. **Semaphore Control**:
   - Semaphores (`ticket`, `flavour`, `topping`, `payment`) regulate access to critical resources.
   - Prevents race conditions and ensures fairness.

3. **Animation and Display**:
   - Customers are visually represented as sprites.
   - Progress through stages is displayed via animations and text on the GUI.

### c. Class Structure
- **Button**: Handles GUI button interactions.
- `draw()`: Renders customer progress and updates the GUI dynamically.

## Execution Flow
1. Start the application.
2. Use the GUI to select the number of customers.
3. Watch customer progress through:
   - Ticket acquisition.
   - Flavor selection.
   - Topping addition.
   - Payment and exit.
4. Total revenue is displayed at the end of the simulation.

---

## Challenges Addressed
- **Synchronization**: Avoided deadlocks and race conditions using semaphores.
- **Concurrency**: Successfully managed multiple customer threads simultaneously.
- **User Interface**: Provided an engaging GUI to enhance user interaction.

---

## Applications
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for teaching concurrency and synchronization concepts.
- **Resource Management**: Basis for developing industrial resource management systems.

---

## Conclusion
The Ice-Cream Factory simulation effectively demonstrates the use of multithreading, semaphores, and graphical programming to solve a synchronization problem. It offers a blend of technical rigor and visual appeal, making it suitable for both academic purposes and demonstrations.
